Official
1. Use 4 spaces for tabs.
2. Variable and function names are lowercase, if needed add an underscore.
    ex. xcoord
        firstname
        entire_entry
        
3. Classes use PascalCase (ex PascalCase).
4. Constants should use all uppercase with words seperated by underscore.

My conventions.
Classes

1. Variables you shouldn't fuck with outside the class should begin with
   an underscore. There is a python private convention which involves
   using two leading underscores, but I think that's gross. Most people
   just use one leading underscore. Python's idea is that we're adults
   we should be able to not touch variables that shouldn't be touched.
   
2. Getters/Setters should not be used, in favor of properties instead.
   Class variables should start as public, then we can use properties
   and make them private later.

3. All classes must extend the object class. This allows for properties
   to be used.
    ex. class Light(object):
            ...
            
Imports

1. Never ever import using wildcards (ex from mymodule import *).
2. When importing a class use "from mymodule import myclass"
3. When importing a built in library put it at the top of the file.
4. When importing a PyQuester module/class always put it at the bottom
   unless it is needed for constant definitions. This is done to avoid
   cyclic import problems. The exception to this rule is main.py.

General
1. All python filenames should be lowercase.
2. I personally do not like multiline comments """ multiline! """ but am
   open to debate about them.
3. Booleans should be is_something or has_something.
4. Comments should be of the following format:
   # This is a comment.
   NOT
   #this is supposedly a comment.
